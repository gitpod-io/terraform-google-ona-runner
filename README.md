# Ona GCP Runner

[![Build with Ona](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/gitpod-io/terraform-google-ona-runner)

This is the Terraform module for the Ona GCP Runner. It deploys an
[Ona](https://ona.com) runner in your Google Cloud VPC, where each development
environment runs as a Compute Engine instance inside your project — source code
and credentials never leave your infrastructure.

> GCP Runners require an [Enterprise plan](https://ona.com/pricing).
> To get access, [contact our sales](https://ona.com/contact/sales).

Refer to [the Ona documentation](https://ona.com/docs/ona/runners/gcp/overview)
for setup instructions, configuration options, and troubleshooting.
